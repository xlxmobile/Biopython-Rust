## Implementation Rationale

Prioritization strategy is guided by several key principles:

1. **Foundation First**: Building low-level optimization frameworks first ensures that all subsequent features benefit from these optimizations.

2. **Data Structures Drive Performance**: Well-designed sequence data structures determine the efficiency of all operations, making them a high priority.

3. **Compute-Intensive Operations**: Prioritize operations like search, matching, and translation where Rust can provide the most significant performance improvements over Python.

4. **User Value**: Each phase delivers concrete functionality that users can immediately benefit from, even as development continues.

5. **Rust Strengths**: Focus first on areas where Rust's performance, memory safety, and concurrency features offer the greatest advantages.
